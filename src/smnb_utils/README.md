The `.py` files originated from `src/common` (which no longer exist by now).
This repo uses only `misc.py` in some of the `notebooks/*.ipynb`. However, the
remaining unused `.py` files are still retained here for reference.

Note also that `docker_utils.py` in this directory is different from
`src/sagemaker_rl/docker_utils.py`.
